    "# BlackJack Card Game # \n",
    "#### The objective of the Blackkack is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding 21 to win money. The player and dealer are dealt with two cards initally and the player will make a decision to draw another card until they are satisfied or stand. Then, the dealer will do the same. Whoever wins gets the amount betted. The player can continue playing until they are out of money or until there are no more cards. ####"
